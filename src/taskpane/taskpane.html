    <h1>MacOS Dialog Roaming Settings Bug</h1>
    <p>This is a demonstration of an Outlook for MacOS bug. Outlook for MacOS cannot properly save or read roaming settings from a dialog box.</p>
    <p>Roaming settings should be the same wherever they're read from in an Add-in and they should be persistant through closes and opens of a dialog.</p>
    <p>On MacOS, however they are not. Dialogs cannot read or write roaming settings properly.</p>
    <p>Try opening the dialog, and setting the value inside to true or false. The setting should persist when you close the dialog and open it back up.</p>
    <p>This will work if done from the Taskpane, but no the Dialog.</p>
